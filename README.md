# Cinegy Managed SRT Tools 


# Auto Building

Just to make your life easier, we auto-build this using AppVeyor - here is how we are doing right now: 

Cinegy SRT Tools Build Status:

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/e74bhgj9ywocnwr4?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cinegy/cinegy-srt)

You can check out the latest compiled binary from the master or pre-master code here:

This does disappear after a period of time

We forked the main SRT library here, https://github.com/Cinegy/srt, mainly to allow us to strap some automatic building steps to the core which we can use to then build these downstream tools. Grab binaries from this fork from this location.
